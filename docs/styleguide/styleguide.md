# TypeScript StyleGuide and Coding Conventions

> An official TypeScript StyleGuide

People have asked me for my opinions on this. Personally I don't enforce these a lot my teams and projects but it does help to have these mentioned as a tie breaker when someone feels the need to have such strong consistency. There are other things that I feel much more strongly about and those are covered in the [tips chapter](./docs/tips/main.md) (e.g. type assertion is bad, property setters are bad) ðŸŒ¹.

Key Sections:

* [Variable](#variable-and-function)
* [Class](#class)
* [Interface](#interface)
* [Type](#type)
* [Namespace](#namespace)
* [Enum](#enum)
* [`null` vs. `undefined`](#null-vs-undefined)
* [Formatting](#formatting)
* [Single vs. Double Quotes](#quotes)
* [Tabs vs. Spaces](#spaces)
* [Use semicolons](#semicolons)
* [Annotate Arrays as `Type[]`](#array)

## Variable and Function
* Use `camelCase` for variable and function names

> Reason: Conventional JavaScript

**Bad**
```ts
var FooVar;
function BarFunc() { }
```
**Good**
```ts
var fooVar;
function barFunc() { }
```

## Class
* Use `PascalCase` for class names.

> Reason: This is actually fairly conventional in standard JavaScript.

**Bad**
```ts
class foo { }
```
**Good**
```ts
class Foo { }
```
* Use `camelCase` of class members and methods

> Reason: Naturally follows from variable and function naming convention.

**Bad**
```ts
class Foo {
    Bar: number;
    Baz() { }
}
```
**Good**
```ts
class Foo {
    bar: number;
    baz() { }
}
```
## Interface

* Use `PascalCase` for name.

> Reason: Similar to class

* Use `camelCase` for members.

> Reason: Similar to class

* **Don't** prefix with `I`

> Reason: Unconventional. `lib.d.ts` defines important interfaces without an `I` (e.g. Window, Document etc).

**Bad**
```ts
inteface IFoo {
}
```
**Good**
```ts
inteface Foo {
}
```

## Type

* Use `PascalCase` for name.

> Reason: Similar to class

* Use `camelCase` for members.

> Reason: Similar to class


## Namespace

* Use `PascalCase` for names

> Reason: Convention followed by the TypeScript team. Namespaces are effectively just a class with static members. Class names are `PascalCase` => Namespace names are `PascalCase`

**Bad**
```ts
namespace foo {
}
```
**Good**
```ts
namespace Foo {
}
```

## Enum

* Use `PascalCase` for enum names

> Reason: Similar to Class. Is a Type.

**Bad**
```ts
enum color {
}
```
**Good**
```ts
enum Color {
}
```

* Use `PascalCase` for enum member

> Reason: Convention followed by TypeScript team i.e. the language creators e.g `SyntaxKind.StringLiteral`. Also helps with translation (code generation) of other languages into TypeScript.

**Bad**
```ts
enum Color {
    red
}
```
**Good**
```ts
enum Color {
    Red
}
```

## Null vs. Undefined

* Use `null` to demonstrate explicit lack of value

> Reason: It is conventional in NodeJS e.g. `error` is `null` for NodeBack style callbacks.

**Bad**
```ts
let error = undefined;
```
**Good**
```ts
let error = null;
```

* Use *truthy* check for `null` / `undefined` e.g.

**Bad**
```ts
if (error !== null)
```
**Good**
```ts
if (error)
```

## Formatting
The TypeScript compiler ships with a very nice formatting language service. Whatever output it gives by default is good enough to reduce the cognitive overload on the team.

Use [`tsfmt`](https://github.com/vvakame/typescript-formatter) to automatically format your code on the command line. Also your IDE (atom/vscode/vs/sublime) already has formatting support built-in.

## Quotes

* Prefer double quotes (`"`).

> Reasons: Allows easier copy paste of objects into JSON. Allows people to use other languages to work without changing their quote character. Allows you to use apostrophe s e.g. `He's not going.`.


* When you can't use double try back ticks (\`).

> Reason: These generally represent the intent of complex enough strings.

## Spaces

* Use `4` spaces. Not tabs.

> Reason: The TypeScript team does this. More JavaScript teams do this. This is the default setting in the TypeScript language service.

## Semicolons

* Use semicolons.

> Reasons: Explicit semicolons helps language formatting tools give consistent results. ASI (automatic semicolon insertion) can trip new devs e.g. `return` statements.

## Array

* Annotate arrays as `foos:Foo[]` instead of `foos:Array<Foo>`.

> Reasons: Its easier to read. Its used by the TypeScript team. Makes easier to know something is an array as the mind is trained to detect `[]`.
