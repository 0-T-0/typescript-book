## Readonly
TypeScript's type system allows you to mark individual properties on an interface as `readonly`. This allows you to work in a functional way (unexpected mutation is bad):

```ts
function foo(config:{
    readonly bar: number,
    readonly bas: number
}){
    // ..
}

let config = {bar:123,bas:123};
foo(config);
// You can be sure that `config` isn't changed ðŸŒ¹
```

Of course you can use `readonly` in `interface` and `type` definitions as well e.g.:

```ts
type Foo = {
    readonly bar: number;
    readonly bas: number;
}

// Initialization is okay
let foo: Foo = { bar: 123, bas: 456 };

// Mutation is not
foo.bar = 456; // Error: Left-hand side of assignment expression cannot be a constant or a read-only property
```

You can even declare a class property as `readonly`. You can initialize them at the point of declaration or in the constructor as shown below:

```ts
class Foo {
    readonly bar = 1; // OK
    readonly baz: string;
    constructor() {
        this.baz = "hello";  // OK
    }
}
```

### Various Use Cases

#### ReactJS
One library that loves immutability is ReactJS and its a great idea to mark your `Props` and `State` to be immutable e.g.

```ts
interface Props {
    readonly foo: number;
}
interface State {
    readonly bar: number;
}
export class Something extends React.Component<Props,State> {
    // You can rest assured no one is going to do
    // this.props.foo = 123; (props are immutable)
    // this.state.bar = 456; (one should use this.setState)
}
```

#### Seamless Immutable

You can even mark index signatures as readonly:

```ts
/**
 * Declaration
 */
interface Foo {
    readonly[x: number]: number;
}

/**
 * Usage
 */
let foo: Foo = { 0: 123, 2: 345 };
console.log(foo[0]);   // Okay (reading)
foo[0] = 456;          // Error (mutating) : Readonly
```

This is great if you want to use native JavaScript arrays in an *immutable* fashion. In fact TypeScript ships with a `ReadonlyArray<T>` interface to allow you to do just that:

```ts
let foo: ReadonlyArray<number> = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(foo[0]);   // Okay
foo.push(4);           // Error: `push` does not exist on ReadonlyArray as it mutates the array
foo = foo.concat([4]); // Okay: create a copy
```

#### Automatic Inference
In some cases the compiler can automatically infer a particular item to be readonly e.g. within a class if you have a property that only has a getter but no setter, it is assumed readonly e.g.:

```ts
class Person {
    firstName: string = "John";
    lastName: string = "Doe";
    get fullName(){
        return this.firstName + this.lastName;
    }
}

const person = new Person();
console.log(person.fullName); // John Doe
person.fullName = "Dear Reader"; // Error! fullName is readonly
```
