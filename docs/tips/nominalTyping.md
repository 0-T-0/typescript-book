## Nominal Typing
The TypeScript type system is structural [and this is one of the main motivating benefits](../why-typescript.md). However, there are real-world use cases for a system where you want two variables to be differentiated because they have a different *type name* even if they have the same structure. A very common use case is *identity* structures

// TODO motivate
// Provide fix
// Demonstrate _Brand convention
