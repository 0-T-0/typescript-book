TypeScript Deep Dive
=======

I've been looking at the issues that turn up commonly when people start using TypeScript. This is based on the lessons from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/typescript/topusers) / [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/) and general engagement with the [TypeScript community](https://github.com/TypeStrong/). You can [follow for updates](https://twitter.com/basarat).

If you are here to read the book [get started](http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/getting-started.html).

You can also do one of the following:
* [EPUB for iPad,iPhone,Mac](https://www.gitbook.com/download/epub/book/basarat/typescript)
* [PDF for Windows and others](https://www.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/basarat/typescript)
* [MOBI for Kindle](https://www.gitbook.com/download/mobi/book/basarat/typescript)

### Contributing

This book is developed using [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook). Authored in Markdown files (I use [atom](http://atom.io)).

Here's how to setup a Dev Environment:

```
npm install gitbook-cli -g
gitbook serve .
```
Note: serve needs port `35729` (for live reload) and `4000` for serving http://localhost:4000.

Also you can mostly just edit the `.md` files in [`/docs`](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/docs) using github and create a Pull Request (PR).
