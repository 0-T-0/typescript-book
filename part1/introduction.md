# Getting Started With TypeScript

TypeScript compiles into JavaScript. JavaScript is what you are actually going to execute (either in the browser or on the server). So you are going to need the following:

* TypeScript compiler (OSS available [in source](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/) and on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript))
* A TypeScript editor (traditionally visual studio)
* Some build pipeline for a build server

Traditionally you would need to set all these up (and more) but we're trying to consolidate all this into a single Atom Package : [Atom-TypeScript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript). The only thing you need to share and collaborate on TypeScript projects across platforms (Windows / Mac / Linux).

So:
1. Install [atom](https://atom.io/).
1. `apm install atom-typescript`
1. Fire up atom. Wait (around 5 mins) for the message: `AtomTS: Dependencies installed correctly. Enjoy TypeScript â™¥`

Now create a new `.ts` TypeScript file and start hacking away. AtomTS will take care of compiling it to `.js` and create a default [`tsconfig.json` TypeScript project file](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/tsconfig.md) for you.

With a dev setup out of the way lets jump into TypeScript syntax.


# Why TypeScript
There are two main goals of TypeScript:
* Provider an *optional type system* for JavaScript.
* Provide features of future JavaScript version to current JavaScript engines.

We find it best to explain these in separation in first go.

## The TypeScript type system

### Your JavaScript is TypeScript
TypeScript provides compile time Type safety for your JavaScript code. This is no surprise given its name. The great thing is that the types are completely optional. Your JavaScript code `.js` file can be renamed to a `.ts` file and TypeScript will still give you back valid `.js` equivalent to the original JavaScript file. TypeScript is *intentionally* and strictly a superset of JavaScript with optional Type checking.

### Types are Inferred
In order to give you type safety with minimal cost of productivity during new code development. E.g. TypeScript will know that foo is of type `number` below and will give an error on the second line as shown:

```ts
var foo = 123;
foo = '456'; // Error: cannot assign `string` to `number`

// Is foo a number or a string?
```
The motivation is that if you do stuff like this, in the rest of your code you cannot be certain that `foo` is a `number` or a `string`. Such issues turn up often in large multi-file code bases. We will deep dive into the type inference rules later.

### Why Types?
* Increase you agility when doing refactorings
* Types are one of the best forms of documentation you can have. *The function signature is a theorem and the function body is the proof*.

### Types can be Specified
As we've mentioned before, TypeScript will infer as much as it can safely, however you can use annotations to:
* Help along the compiler, and more importantly the next developer who has to read your code (that might be future you!).
* Enforce that what the compiler sees is, what you thought it should see. That is your understanding of the code matches an algorithmic analysis of the code (done by the compiler).

TypeScript uses postfix type annotations popular in other *optionally* annotated languages (e.g. ActionScript).
